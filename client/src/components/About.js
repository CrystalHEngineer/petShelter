            <p>We love pets just as much as you do! Until these pets find their forever homes though, 
            we provide the love and care that they all need and deserve now. We do our best to keep 
            the shelter a stress-free environement. All animals are fed a species-appropriate diet, 
            are regularly engaged in play with our staff and other animals of the same breed, groomed, 
            cuddled and loved. No matter what the circumstances brought them here or what life stage 
            they are at, every animal deserves love, a home and a family; and we hope you'll be just 
            that for one (or more!) of the animals here.</p>
