                    We love pets just as much as you do! Until these pets find their forever homes though, 
                    we provide the love and care that they all need and deserve <em>now</em>. We do our best
                    to keep the shelter a stress-free environement. All animals are fed a species-appropriate
                    diet, are regularly engaged in play with our staff and other animals, groomed, cuddled and
                    loved. No matter what the circumstances brought them here or what life stage they are at, 
                    every animal deserves love, a home and a family. We hope you'll be just that for one 
                    (or more!) of the animals here.
